#Sum and Difference
Q.Write a python program to get 2 numbers from the user and calculate their sum and difference using '+' and '-' operators respectively. 
Print the corresponding sum and difference of the numbers as output in the console.

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(a+b)
print(a-b)

#Product and Division
Q.Write a python program to get 2 numbers from the user and calculate their product, quotient and remainder using '*', '/' and '%' operators respectively.
Print the corresponding product, quotient and remainder of the numbers as output in the console. 

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(a*b)
print(a//b)
print(a%b)

#Swapping of two numbers
Q.Write a python program to get 2 numbers from the user and swap their values without any loss of data. You can make use of additional 3rdvariable for swapping.
Print the corresponding swapped values of the two numbers as output in the console. 

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a
a=b
b=c
print(a)
print(b)

#Swapping without third variable
Q.Write a python program to swap two values without the use of 3rd variable. 

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
(a,b)=(b,a)
print(a)
print(b)

#Average Calculation
Q.A teacher wants to compute the average of 5 students in her class. Write a program to help her to find the average. 
The average is the sum of all the numbers, then divided by the total numbers. 

#program:-
a=float(input())
b=float(input())
c=float(input())
d=float(input())
e=float(input())
print((a+b+c+d+e)/5)

#Alice in Wonderland

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=(a//10)
c=(a%10)
