print(a*b)
print(a//b)
print(a%b)

#Swapping of two numbers
Q.Write a python program to get 2 numbers from the user and swap their values without any loss of data. You can make use of additional 3rdvariable for swapping.
Print the corresponding swapped values of the two numbers as output in the console. 

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a
a=b
b=c
print(a)
print(b)

#Swapping without third variable
Q.Write a python program to swap two values without the use of 3rd variable. 

#program:-
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
(a,b)=(b,a)
print(a)
print(b)

#Average Calculation
Q.A teacher wants to compute the average of 5 students in her class. Write a program to help her to find the average. 
The average is the sum of all the numbers, then divided by the total numbers. 

#program:-

b=float(input())
c=float(input())
d=float(input())
e=float(input())
print((a+b+c+d+e)/5)

#Alice in Wonderland
Q.Alice was bored that day,so she was sitting on the riverbank .Suddenly she notices a talking, White Rabbit with a pocket watch .It ran fast,and she followed it, down a rabbit hole .

The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

#program:-
a=int(input())
l=int(input())
b=int(input())
r=float(input())
print(a**2)
print(l*b)
print("%.2f"%((3.14)*(r**2)))

#Fencing the ground
Q.The college ground is rectangular in shape. The Management decides to build a fence around the ground.

They also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet during rainy season. They wanted to buy only the exact quantity of carpet that is needed. They requested your help. Can you please help them by writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact quantity of carper that is required? 

#program:-
l=int(input())
b=int(input())
p=2*(l+b)
A=l*b
print("required length is",p,"m")
print("required quantity of carpet is",A,"sqm")

#Power of a Number
Q.pow() function is used to calculate the power of any base and it is defined in math header file. Write a program to read X as the base and N as the power and calculate the result (X^N - X to the power of N). 

#program:-
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
print(pow(x,y))

#Simple Interest

#Splitting into Teams
Q.During the Physical Education hour, PET sir has decided to conduct some team games. He wants to split the students in the class into equal sized teams. In some cases, there may be some students who are left out from teams and he wanted to use the left out students to assist him in conducting the team games. 
For instance, if there are 50 students in the class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal sized teams, 7 students will be there in each team and 1 student will be left out. PET sir asks your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out? 

#program
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=(a//b)
d=(a%b)
print(f"the number of students in each team is {c} and left out is {d}")
